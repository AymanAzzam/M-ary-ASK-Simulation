# M-ary-ASK-Simulation
Simulation and analysis of the Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) and its Bit Error Rate (BER).

# Important Equations
1. Eb = E0 * summation(ai^2)/N , where N is the total number of bits. In this example assume Eb = 1 to get E0.
2. SNR = Eb/N0.
3. Variance = N0/2.
4. Standard Deviation = sqrt(Variance).
